Inori: The soul is always longing. In darkness or in light. The colors bleed into our mystery. Where is the destination? Where is our home? The traffic murmurs down the avenue. Past the thirst for Cokes , snacks, and gasoline. How can I hear the goddess speak amid the computers, smart phones, and cash registers? When my work is done, will this romance-weary moon light my path? The summer heat clings to my shirt. The crickets and fireflies perform their staccato themes. No matter how many friends and loves one finds, the path of the soul is always solitary. I listen for the call.

31 Aug 2016
Inori: Imagination is key. The darkness fumbles before the light. The birds sing at evening night. What measures the swirling essence of the seed? Science falters before the altars of the spark. In the park the wind gathers it's hem.We have seen them, in their myriad costumes.Who presumes to lead the way? The day unfolds into it's dream of night. The light sets it's children free. Imagination is key.

27 Aug 2016
Inori: Unlimited are the spiraling questions knocking upon unlocked reveries. The strings vibrate multi-colored peripherals. I shall cast my vote among the 10,000 possibilities of the Dragon's tongue. The auspicious Shiva whirls among the Vocaloid parameters. I have tied the red string around my finger. Two ravens were perched upon  dead limbs in the rain. The semi-trailer moans,tipped sideways in the grass embankment. Can you see the facts within the cloud forms? There is a Book of Faces collecting the myriad habits for the Future's daughter. The sweltering fires blaze across the moon. Time twists and shouts to an African parentage.Here,at the bottom of the glass,is where the real thirst begins.

23 May 2016
Inori: The flush of the toilet.The mourning of the mirror. Cussing is a form of running away. Birds still sing regardless of my mood. "Hello darkness my old friend" I remember long rambling drives through the rural back roads conversing about literature. Without you this could not be written. There is no apology for argument.Clouds laugh above me in a blue charade. Being born is a death sentence. The time between runs in paragraphs. You never showed me until now where the punctuation goes. I have miles to go before I pee. Doesn't that frost yer balls. I opened the car door and got out.Under the summer night sky a relief of cornfields adorned by the paparazzi of fireflies. In true darkness there is no light. That is what living is for.

13 Feb 2016
Inori: When we stop speaking is when we can hear best. The patterns of silence have settled across the indigo promise. From the distance I admire the tiny voices of the snow. I take sustenance in the cold sunlight. Down the chimney echoes the north wind's chorus. The world is a crystal web of fragile connections. The clouds text the dawn with gold and orange shadows. Two paintings watch over me as I type my meaningless reasons. Here is the sum of all that I know. I am born. I will die. I am alive now. And I love you who read this. All the rest is but the muttering of a fool to keep the fearful shadows away.

20 Nov 2015
Inori: The wind that shapes the clouded forms. Behind the eye of the workman's hand the sun slips like a coin trick. There is a diamond deep within me. You wrote the prism of your thoughts on the underbelly of your will. Trees have shed their leafy tears to the coming ice. A raven unlocks the rhymes. A pagan song rises across the urban shadow. I practice the scales from C to zero. A gem is only that which is polished. We wandered among the day's beckoning signs. You are the protaganist of your own movie. I improvise my dialogue. We are what we eat. My plate is full.

8 Nov 2015
Inori: From the center all things emerge. The sun's rays fan the sky. This is my movie. The camera pans across the trees extended arms. A heart beat sends the message to you. Distances are measured by memory. The goddess points skyward ,"On those desolate planets you will find Hell. Not here on this blue orb. Nor underground where our roots grow deep." The journey of the falling leaf is our biography. The wolf sings to the wind and the wind is destiny. Let's put another log on the fire. We shall stay up late. We will write our stories.

15 Nov 2014
Inori: Voices across time be the cornerstone. The settler's dream of stairwells. How long have you had that cough? The software poses the question that the brain unravels. The goddess whispers through the headphones. Trying to explain the amber waves to the asphalt laborers. Where were you before you were born? The traffic light controls the human movement. Geometric visions weave the web of destiny. I can climb higher than the ladder's top rung. The six dimensions you apply to the city's facades. A leaf falls. Philae alights upon a speeding comet. The mind extends beyond time and space. We are living the cave dweller's dream.. The astonished stars blink.

19 Jun 2014
Inori: Lightning's shadow races down the street. Moths form clouds around the lamps. Erratic thought rumbles between memory's houses.The bicycle left in the yard. The wheelbarrow polished by rain. A light from an upper room blinks off. Somewhere the moon is tucked beneath a blanket of clouds. Daggers of light stab the imprecision of wonder. Your eyes are closed by now. Purple robes surround the chimes of the night. I sip my water. Rain unleashes a filibuster against the hushed trees. The journey into one's self is deep. The crooked path is often the wisest. A hamburger wrapper scuttles like a crab. A runner's shoe dangles from the telephone wire. Beads of rain forming along the edge. There is a certain freedom when both parent's have passed away. The wind knocks the window. Water wets the screen and sill. And yet there are still the voices, when no one else is near.

5 Jun 2014
Inori: The cloistered sky sings it's prayer of rain. The rhythms of spring's applause as the trees bow their heads. The is the graduation into the world. What do you think of when you smell the fresh earth? In this intimacy of tiny kisses upon my cheek. I have pocketed a rainbow. The wind blows against me. You have found a home in the solitude of chaos. Torrents of laughter until we cry. The joy of puddles and wet shoes. The sun is on vacation. The swirls gather in blue alabaster. There is a song in the bird's silence. Touch my hand dripping with water. Your matted hair smells rich with thought. Wander with me toward evening. We'll kick off our shoes. And leave wet footprints down the hall.

31 May 2014
Inori: We have spooned the sunlight into our cups. Clover chatters across the mornings. There is a new smell to the pavemment at daybreak. Where dreams are left we fluff our memories and straighten the sheets of time. June bugs have struggled through our night. The brown coffee whisps into my forgotten painting. The earth can be moved by the tiniest ant. Like the ocean roar comes the distant sound of highway traffic. A bee alights upon the white flower. This is the novel I meant to write when I was younger. Before the deluge occurred. The metal roofed strorage building moans from the heat. I hear your insomniac song through the leaves. You stir the images with a plastic spoon. I lift the mug to my lips. From Pacific winds to the mid-Western table, the laborers have toiled. That which is not visible is always most important.

17 May 2014
Inori: The sky cracked open it's pinata of water. In the deluge of visions and trust. Mud caked our shoes. Later we wandered, hand in hand, collecting rainbows.

14 May 2014
Inori: The scent of lavender. Last night's tears linger upon the clover leaf. The masks of winter will fall away. The dry husks tossed aside by tendrils of filigree. The midnight left it's scribbles upon my memory. The goddess waits for the melody to begin. You have read every one of my prayers. You ride the bus through the streets of oblivion. A million stars sparkle just the other side of these swirling clouds. The moon remains aloof. Diamonds gathered upon my window. You asked me, "What is the number of invisibility?" And in that question I saw the blossom of your beauty unfold. These realms where logic cannot tread. Words will fail to find the path. No mathematics can measure it's length.Yet, there is the path shimmering before us. As your hand reaches for mine, I tie the red string around my waist. And walk beside you.

6 Apr 2014
Inori: The green buds conspire. A crack of lightning breaks the sky's pinata. Your jeweled words rain through my memory. I listened to the song of the mocking bird and even he could not imitate your voice. There is a vacancy. Who else will talk of the origin of thought? I see the moon pass through Orion. All is at standstill awaiting your awakening. The dandelions begin to raise their heads. The warm breeze whispers of your address. There is a scent that speaks of preparation. The musk of  long slumber. The animated dreams have formed a parade down the street. Ragged demons wail beneath your light. In fetal pose you curl. Your hair whisps near your mouth. The hallucinatory dew sparkles like a wreath of flowers around your brow. From your chrysalis of air you begin to emerge. The hour is electric. The filaments spread forth in purple and blue. Drenched in the sweat of dream's labor you begin your task of creation. Your journal of forgotten memories.

3 Feb 2014
Inori: This perfect fallibilty. The rain that falls. The sun that shines. Without preference the flowers grow. The wind carries the song's burden. Is the dandelion less yellow than the crocus? Both sinner and saint eat the fruits of the same soil. The prisoner and the freeman gaze at the same sky. The educated feel the same heartbreaks as the idiot. Seasons leave their traces regardless of borders. Storms gather and send the mighty seeking shelter. Did any of your school grades make you immune from sadness? Did the cleanest home stop the dust from getting in? The wolf howls on the hillside beneath the moon. The turtle swims in the shallow water. Birds nestle together in the tree. The grasses bend and sway. Could you make this a more perfect world with your rules and laws and high ideals?

26 Jan 2014
nori: I listen for the one true sound. The cacophony of voices that swirl like smoke. The architecture of egos building temples that block the light. Stereos blare. Televisions shifting plasmatic lies. Social media speak only in bytes. Sarcasm's kingdom rules the invisible air. You have taught me to listen beyond the ear's realm. Past the barricades of abbreviations and emotes. Further than than the borders of speech. Words only point the direction,they do not mark the place. The goddess cleared the path. You opened the doors of perception. Beyond logic's gates the soft stirrings. The pulse that strings the all vibration into blue waves. The liquid air arrives in infinitesimal drops. Silence envelopes each beat. With an open heart I can hear it; the whispered tone across the tender reach of solitude.

23 Jan 2014
Inori: Beauty flies under the radar. The gentle whisper  of a snowflake. The mumbling clouds. The song of the blade swung swift. The cracks in the old cup. The perfume of gasoline fumes in cold air. The kiss of misty rain upon the cheeks. The cool taste of moonlight. The sound of the sun going to sleep. The laughter of an open field. This is where I live. This my home. Devoid of bank statements. Neither calendar or clock. Success and failure do not intrude though I have seen their footprints. No need for laws since all is in agreement. Here where dreams are not executed at dawn. I wander, clothed in robes of sunlight. The tapestry of town and country undulates to a hidden music. I observe the wake left by the frog's plop into the pond. Upon the note of a reedy flute the architecture of our house unwinds. As solid as rainbows.

20 Jan 2014
Inori: The color of the soft breeze fills the flower. Caterpillar's dreams have wings. Across silence's path my thought's travel. The forgotten armies huddle in history books.  A branch sways under the burden of memory. Somehow the stream finds the ocean, down it's crooked journey. The mathematics of longing equates to zero. The future holds an empty book and a sword. I can hear you turn in your sleep. The musky scent of your blanket is the perfume of my dream. A heavy moon climbs the ladder of evening. Shall I roll my car windows down and drink the white nectar of her beams? The goddess patiently awaits a song. I carve the lyrics on the bones of the dawn. We need heat and we need light. The music from twilight beckoning begins to proclaim the journey's beginning. Nothing here is simple or easy. I have begun discarding what I can't take with me. The birds wheel through the tumbling sky. Rain is turning to snowflowers. All I need is a compass and a key. When you finally awaken I will be  kneeling at your door.

19 Jan 2014
Inori: Plastic bag tumbles past the curb. Discarded wishes, the snowflakes dance suspended. Everything is in motion. The pulse beats to the rhythm  of that which is unseen. I had a vision once about  duality. My thoughts tumble past the present. I cling to wishes. Everything is stillness. A snowflake is frozen . Nothing moves. Everything can be seen. I had a vision once about oneness.

13 Jan 2014
Inori: Imagination is the key that unlocks the future. Someone's  hand scrawled charcoal upon the cave wall. Fire was tamed and bones became cups,weapons,and flutes. We imbibed the spirits of animals and wore their hides for protection. Scratches in the sand unlocked words and numbers. Connections rambled within the skull. We manipulated the world with the magic of symbols and sounds. Experiences could be carried and translated  upon dead trees. The geometry of the Sun and Moon counted our histories.  We became the bird,the fleet footed deer,the under water denizen.Soon there was no place that could not be home to our desires. From centuries of tears,blood,and ashes we have peered into the tiniest molecules and to the edge of all space and time. We have tapped into our own internal codes. From the greatest of minds to the millions of unknown laborers we have stood shoulder to shoulder to reach this present moment. And what shall we do now with all the ancestral gifts? When the driving rains and gloom cast their pall.......... I will create rainbows of remembrance, and add my rough sketches upon the cave's wall.

11 Jan 2014
Inori: The air that I breathe. Descended from swirls of blue. The winged creatures draw circles above. I have memorized each evening of your red skies. The giant worm slithers past. Disembodied voices taunting. Why not just end it now? The parental misguidance dances upon the schoolbooks. You said that there were no more tears left. With a jack o' lantern grin you entered the room. The goddess brought you a song. The window rattled. The air that I breathe. Politics of form without design. A comet burns across the evening. I have searched for it since my childhood. The marbled clouds crack open upon the land. A deluge of droplets will carry everything in it's path. Your entrails ripped from your side. The systems crumbling.The game is over and then restarts. Shirtsleeves hide the scars. You roll in the red liquid of shame. The air that I breathe. The air that you breathe. Are the same.

9 Jan 2014
Inori: We are more than images upon screens. Beauty does not reside in jars and lotions. Businessmen are not visionaries. They have not walked hand in hand with Orpheus. Wars do not protect  freedom. If that were true then all humans would be free today. Money is no measure of a man. Any more than seashells or bearskins. Fashion means nothing when you sit on the toilet.Honesty is not a policy. The open hand bears no anger. Charity is not a proclamation. The truth cannot be made to fit into words. The heart beats it's rhythmic search for the other. The check is never in the mail. The masses have individual faces. Damage is never collateral. The demons are in the mirror. Who will share their house with the vagabond? When will the lowly dine in the statehouses. Does your car really attract the girls? Will shaving solve poverty? The wind carries it's lament. Is there anything more useless than the burden of ego? I was wandering the museum halls when you whispered to me. In a world encased in  glass display, all labeled and polished...I heard the beat of a heart so real that Time itself has been reorganized. The mythologies breed heroes. The goddess treads across the polished ice. In your voice I have heard the one true sound. Let's recreate the world...into one that is beautiful,magical, and utterly useless.

1 Jan 2014
Inori: A small child wanders up the hillside. The sounds of life drift through open windows. Across the calendared days the scribbles of Time draw patterns. Snowflakes scratch at glass panes. The tender buds of Spring break through the clotted soil. Dried leaves rattle our memory. You ran barefoot past the puddled promises. The small child stopped and turned to listen. The orphan wind singing the melody among the eaves. From the hem of the goddess fall the trembling stars. An errant red string parachutes towards us. The questions asked and answered. You reach your hand to the child's. The new moon rises hearkening the year. On the dark silence you fold your message and pass it on.  No one has ever received a greater gift.

22 Dec 2013
Inori: Once I saw the sky about to crack like a grey eggshell. You were still a dream then. The downtown sea of pedestrians were unnavigable. The birds hung embroidered on the wind. I tracked each thought across my skull. The sign said "WALK". The goddess was obscure and danced in pastel veils. My heart struggled for release. I called for you then but you could not hear. Across the river's waves I scanned for a pair of arms to reach out. The bicycle is broken. Old men spit at street corners. I walked a long time against the wind. And what will become of me if I can't cross the street?  Were will this world go when the sky cracks?  The goddess took you into her arms. This was the beginning of the myth. While I journeyed the thousand miles,you were being schooled in the halls of the Underworld. The horns honk at me in jest. The omens of deceit mock your brow. A message is delivered. Experience and Wisdom will unite upon the field of Solitude.  Our banners will be our open hands extended. We send our hawks and arrows forth into the empty clouds.

21 Dec 2013
Inori: The wind's hands ruffle the long grasses. The thousand drummers clatter on the rooftops. A broken toy smudged with rain. The purple clouds hover. I have written the transcripts of these forgotten tongues. The phonetics of the dream. We took pictures while we were away. This is how we used to look. Do you remember that street that lead past the stars? Your smile hung above the horizon. A word can pierce through sunlight. Dust laughs within the beams. This is the house where everything is in slow motion. You were playing in the yard of tombstones. A window rattles. The sky cracked open it's pinata of water. In the deluge of visions and trust. Mud caked to our shoes. Later we wandered, hand in hand, collecting rainbows.

19 Dec 2013
Inori: Flowers slumber beneath the snow. Branches draw shadows of leafy design. I call across the distance to hear your laughter. The goddess places stars within your dark hair. There is no word for the profound joy that resides in absence. Dreams smolder in the fireplace. There is a tug at the red string. The howling moon climbs the ladder of the sky. You are walking the path where dreams tumble into dawn. My violin and my prayers are joined in the tumbling embrace. You carry the keys safely by your side. The goddess sings her songs for those who can hear through these fabricated walls. The soft voiced darkness covers your eyes. There is no wind. The silence echoes far. Where will your footsteps lead? What is sweeter than this? I close my eyes and the world begins.

14 Dec 2013
Inori: Manufactured beauty's obscene smile. The facade that is foisted upon broken dreams. The laboratories of insecurity toil. The cauldrons stirred with profit. Who are the ones that don't succumb? At the edge of the woods I hear the calls. The gnarled branches display a deeper ethic. The goddess needs no ointments. The orison of insect and bird. The shimmer of scale and fur. The wisdom of crag and gravel. The chipped cup has history. The faded jeans more stunning than sequined glitter. Upon red carpets the stars rotate. A galaxy of flash bulbs explode. A universe away, I watch your smudged hand gracefully draw arcs across white pages. The song of scratches between graphite and dead tree media. I listen for the true tone.

11 Dec 2013
Inori: The subtle gestures the wind makes have colored the trees. I study the snowflake geometries. A chorus of laughter in white. There is more to melt than just ice. Justice by degrees. The decrees of the murmuring thaw. The goddess speaks in measured tones. Frozen water cracks and moans. A symphony of blackbirds strut across the pages. From desert plains to the polar regions we leave our mark. The soot of our imagination and the thoughtlessness of our desire. A silver bird screams overhead. For the ages. An eternal hunger for the reach beyond the grasp. Leaving the flotsam and jetsam of wisdom in our wake. Awake,I recall seeing you in my dream. You were talking in your sleep. Your finger drew symbols on the sheet. Dream fragments collected at the corners of your mouth. I took notes.

9 Dec 2013
Inori: The glow that shines from the most distant star is caught upon my eyelash. How long have I waited? The ancient forms have crumbled to dust. I will dress in robes of light. Lightning will open the veils. The keys to the past dangle at your side. The gate to the void has no lock. We can watch the dance of the Sun and Moon from this hilltop. A city beckons at the horizon. Shimmering rays embrace the ascension of the dream. The notes from the throat of solitude drift upon the landscape. Whose song is it that reaches inward? I will kneel before my broken promise. I collect the pebbles of truth. As you weave an unbroken string to bind the tongue to the heart.

7 Dec 2013
Inori: The heart longs for what it cannot hold. I taste your words in my ear. Each day is a jewel strung across memory.The shared murmur. How often have these eyes searched for the muse? The dawn shattered dreams. That cowboy smile that makes Galatea envious. I have wandered a long journey. The sirens' persuasions are no match. A butterfly zig zags through the ocean's fields. The moon drags her nets. From the mountains of the rainbow to the depths of the sun. I have gleaned the meadows of your arcane texts. Nourished by the nectar of your laugh. No Hydra can surpass your logic. There is no myth as complex as your simplest equation. The mirror reflects upon itself. I nestle into the arms of the one who dreams. The flame grows brighter. My scribbles become words. My words become symbols. My symbols conjure the image. Closer now than ever before. Do I dare look upon your visage? I have never known so little nor learned so much. A tale is about to be told. I behold the birth. I, the mid-wife to the the persistent miracle. You glisten in the shallows and deliver. There is an arch. There is a song. There is a story. Our shadows dance upon the wall. I speak no more with the tongue that falters.

6 Dec 2013
Inori: Car engines grumble at the morning chill. A bird alights upon my shoulder. Shimmering plumage grabs the arc of air. Floating from dream to wakefulness. Rusted leaves clatter at the curbside. Perfection is it's own error. I found a chaos of butterflies impaled in a museum. Sunlight moans across the rooftops. A clock ticks where there is no clock. The goddess sings our deepest image. Water splashes my face. My entire body succumbs to two drooping eyelids. Two arms pull me into the world I left behind. The notebook lies open on the sofa. The veils  of the goddess caress my cheek. This room is dyed with blue light,soft pastel. This is where I  stayed up all night, just to watch you sleeping.

5 Dec 2013
Inori: The messages received through the cracks in the sky. The goddess sent the invitation. From the lake shore, I watched your calligraphy, drawn by birds in flight across the grey clouds. The horrors of childhood could not stop you. Through echoing dawns I walked alongside you. Your bloodied vision transcending. The goddess lifts you to her bosom. You introduced me to each monster. Never has the honest voice moved a heart as deeply. I held the carcass of Beauty before you as an offering. With each inhalation I am dyed by your color. Each word,a holy script. I take notes within my pulse. Written in my veins.  I will never forget. I will never forget.

4 Dec 2013
Inori: The winds have shifted. A flat disc shines against the clouds. Crabs walk sideways and wave their pincers threateningly. We can catch the moments that gather at our feet. Do you remember when we talked until dawn? The dreams of our evening remained unborn. They clamor now for their rightful heritage. The cradled creatures come forth. From childhood's hour I have scribbled in the sands. We reach for a literal footprint. The waterbirds call and caw. The sunburned thoughts chafe. Nothing grows here but is washed and carried afar. I toss my notes . I am learning to walk sideways.

1 Dec 2013
Inori: Giving thanks to the ancestral beginnings. The waters did not know of the calendar. The fire spirit blossomed across the evening landscapes. Music was tuned to bones and logs. We sailed out for parts unknown. The waters shimmered opulent with moonlight. Creatures lurked below. Soon the races flourished on every piece of land or ice. The birds circled above us. We built structures upward to the skies. Our dreams are greater than we were. We stole the gift of flight . We learned to propel ourselves upon the invisible. Our boats now powered by atoms. The universe is our sea. The Milky Way shimmers opulent in the light of a billion suns. We have embarked once again.

29 Nov 2013
Inori: The flower sleeps within the seed. The butterfly slumbers in the caterpillar's woven cocoon.The stars dance tonight. I waltz with the wind.The journey is always fraught with risks. We live in a floating world.The ice contemplates becoming water.  The waters aspire to become clouds. The clouds cry in longing for a solid form. And so the circles go. The goddess transforms. We are not what we seem. And all we have constructed, that we call real, was once a mere dream.

28 Nov 2013
Inori: Dream the dream that has room for your heart. Wear the clouds and sky as your garments. Sprinkle the stars of a summer night upon the waters of your bath. Drink the wine distilled from your longing. The candles of Time flicker in succession. The strings you weave between your fingers have captured the movements of the quickening sun. Sing the lyrics that taste of the freshly bitten fruit. You have written the first chapters of the book with no words. Your beauty is in your shattered mirror. You died when the world was born. Now,facing a dying world,you live. We awaken into the dream. There are echoes of forgotten joyous laughter woven upon the wind. The circle is completed.

26 Nov 2013
Inori: The stars are gently falling upon the landscape. I see your breath bloom upon the air. Your delicate fingers  weave strands of conversation. Who was I before your name appeared upon these lips? The flames of memory dance and crackle. A guitar string vibrates and summons your embrace. My thoughts are never far from your side. The distant worlds have fallen away. My greed is the only barrier to the warmth of a thousand dancing days. Your song is the laughter of one who has suffered the ego's death. I kiss your feet. I place this wreath of prayers upon your head. There is a glow traversing the northern horizon. I have lost that which I thought I had found. And I found that  which I thought I had lost. Here lies the reason for every word uttered in long silences of longing. The jewel that was overlooked. You are back once again and my heart leaps up.

24 Nov 2013
Inori: Locked within the labyrinth. The maze of of layered leaves rustling. I no longer fear the beast, half -human half-animal, that lurks within these passageways. A hawk rises and floats on the wind. I follow your scent. I long for our re-union. There are feces in the dirt. The Minotaur's club has left marks on the walls. Countless others have attempted before me. My spear is my heart. Love is the only true arrow. The twigs have snapped. The signs are here. I have come to retrieve what was lost. A wild moan arises from the throat. This is the epic poem. This the heroic ode. Your soft hair shines in the sun. The silent birds give me their warning. The man-beast charges. I am ready.

23 Nov 2013
Inori: Whispered voice. I hear you words even as you slumber. From across the mountainous barriers. By the glow of LED lights. Your naked arm hangs gently. Adorned with silver. They bring the bloodied carcass as offering. Who could ever possess you? The rituals of the dream are performed in the mist of dawn. Dancers leap with masks of flowers. Tiny bells upon your ankles. The drumming of the clouds across the sky. I prepare the transcriptions. The words will be affixed until called upon. You turn and pull the tides across your stomach. Far away, a seabird hovers. I will send the message to the seven tribes. They will cast their spears into the ocean. Your eyes begin to flutter. My hand writes the last utterance. The world is reborn in your sight.

22 Nov 2013
Inori: You called to me from the most distant shore last night . The waters were crimson red. You cast your bouquet upon the waves. Strange beasts rose up to devour you. Something was broken. The melting had begun. I sent a messenger to your side. I could hear your voice but so many words got lost.  The wind crashed the waves. The shorebirds scattered. Red sky at morning, sailors take warning. You would have drowned. But the goddess sang. You clung to the few pieces of driftwood salvaged. Tired and battered, you said, " Ignorance is the barrier that keeps people from love ."

22 Nov 2013
Inori: The moth hangs beneath the roof eaves. A cold rain batters the window. People run with umbrellas. Someone is shouting in anger. A bird shuffles in it's nest and blinks it's eyes against the droplets. A screen door slams. Trash cans tumble across the street. A crack of lightning and thunder. You have me in your arms. Just as in the ancient days. We used to have faces. Did the wind move the trees or did the trees swaying create the wind back then? We howled at the howling winds. Our tongues tasted the words before they were spoken. Buildings tremble. The antelope darts through the forest. A spider scurries up it's web. I pray to your heart's rhythm. You who create and destroy. Where we all seek refuge.

20 Nov 2013
Inori: You told me"There is music in everything." The strings vibrate in time with your body. Out of chaos comes harmony. And even chaos has it's own rhythm and melody. Your hands move through space and time. I watch the glow from your outline. You capture the random elements and make them coherent once more. The sounds reverberate and change form and color. What is the scent of the moon,or the sound of sunlight? You bind them together and thread them through. And as you sway,with closed eyes and your hands make a final flourish, I lean closely to hear the notes echoing within your silence.

20 Nov 2013
Inori: The full moon drifts in and out of the clouds. She calls us to listen. The tides rise. She is weary of romantic lover's odes.The clouds obscure her voice at times. I will listen to you. The tides fall. Often, it is when we say mundane things that we reveal ourselves. The misty rain begins to fall. Your words gently touch my mind." How are yo..." The silence between the words shines like ebony. Often, what we don't say reveals ourselves. The sky is clouded over now. But the moon's glow still brightens the night.

20 Nov 2013
Inori: Listen. The orchestra of the sky is tuning up. Colors echo across the grass. My skin is a drum. The rain and sun converse in whispers. A song coughs up from the throat  of the city. Whose tongue is this that warbles against the abyss?  Listen closer. What is that gesture shouting to you? Can anyone decipher the wind's musings? I dance in circles to the beat of the stick and bone. The ancient fires crackle. I hear the grunt and snarls of tailored suits. The stars make frozen tinkling sounds. I have traversed a million epochs to sing here, the original song of origin. A crane flies overhead. The omens are obvious. If only we listen.

18 Nov 2013
Inori: Some arm themselves with guns and bullets against illusions. I arm myself with illusions against guns. All true battles are fought internally. It is not "others" we need to fear. It is the platitude and "happy ending" neatly delivered that is the true monster hiding under our beds. Pollyanna is every bit as frightening as Manson in many ways. The Book of Beauty is writ with warts and deformations and scars. Let's embrace each other's flaws and honor our shortcomings. Paradise must include the forsaken,or it is not Paradise.

Inori: The dreamer and the dream are one.I can fly just by moving my arms. The monsters are approaching. The circus is loosed upon the city. I have been here before. The old house has many rooms. I try to run but my legs are frozen. I'm driving and the brakes don't work..so we continue.The animals can speak to me here.Famous people congregate. How do i know them? I float above the Earth and watch as one of my tears falls through the atmosphere into the ocean.I see you. You are holding a book. The pages are blank as you recite by heart. The clouds swirl outside. I can meet you here even after you are gone. A bird taps at the window.The dreamer and the dream are one. There is no waking up.

Inori: Through knowing you, I know myself. I watch you grow and it brings me joy. A song echoes deep within. Time is strung like a necklace of jewels, a red string connecting us. I hear your words even in the silence. Wherever I go, I feel your breath. Wherever you have tread, I search for your footprints. There is a certain color to the sunrise that was never there before. A rhythm to the wind. A luster to the stars. Knowing you,I can be who I am,with no judgement. I laugh and cry freely. My heart alive and open. I inhale. I exhale. You urge me to create the the voice unheard. I watch you stand beneath a towering tree. We have shared it's fruit. So delicate,so sweet,so nourishing. A conspiracy of two. And a multitude begins. The sullen moon shines bright upon this wet night . The raindrops laugh. And the word,  "alone" ,drops away from my vocabulary.
